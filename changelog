- Changed the way protocols are handled, so now with a new protocol version, McSod 
  will just assume everything works from the previous protocol version.
  - Current protocol version will still need to be updated for the server to not
    show as out of date to a prospective client's server listing.
- Fixed a bug with logging exceptions not printing the stack trace
- Made the project harder to debug in eclipse, but at the same time made it so I 
  won't have to actually use eclipse as much.
